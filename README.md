# Annu Kumari

A minimal, text-first personal website.

This site is intentionally simple. It prioritizes clarity, readability,
and substance over visual design.

It serves as a place to document what I’m working on, how I think, and
the projects I choose to build.

---

## Philosophy

- Content over presentation
- Fewer pages, written carefully
- No animations, no heavy UI
- Browser defaults where possible
- Tailwind used only for spacing and layout

This site is closer to a document than a product landing page.

---

## Structure

- `/` — Overview and navigation
- `/about` — What I work on and what I’m focused on
- `/now` — Current priorities (updated periodically)
- `/projects` — A small selection of past and present work
- `/notes` — Short observations and working thoughts

The homepage is intentionally minimal.
Content pages share a simple side navigation for ease of movement.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (used minimally)
- No UI libraries

- No tracking
